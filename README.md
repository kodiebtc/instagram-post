# instagram-post
python script that uses the instagram private API to download instagram posts


1. Save the script to a file, for example, download_instagram_posts.py.

2. Install the InstagramAPI library if you haven't already done so. You can do this by running pip install InstagramAPI in your terminal.

3. Run the script in your terminal by typing python download_instagram_posts.py <username>, where <username> is the Instagram username of the posts you want to download.
  
4. By default, the script will download the 10 most recent posts from the user's account and save them to a directory named ./downloads. You can change the number of posts to download and the directory to save them to using the optional --num_posts and --save_dir arguments, respectively. For example, python download_instagram_posts.py <username> --num_posts 5 --save_dir ./my_downloads.
  
5. The script will download the posts and save them to the specified directory. Each post will be saved as a separate file with the post ID as the filename and either a .jpg or .mp4 extension depending on whether the post is a photo or video.
